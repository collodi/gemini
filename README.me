build_climbs_json.py - build climbs from moon files
build_nodes_torch.py - leanrs hold embeddings based on occurence on same boulder (output: data/nodes.torch)
build_distances_torch.py - calculates distances among holds (output: data/distances.torch)

datasets.py - generate moonclimbs representations (need: data/climbs.json)
train.py - train the generator (def.d in generator.py) and discriminator (def.d in discriminator.py)

template_graph.py - generates template graphs used as inputs for the generator (used w/ import)
visualize.py - visualizes a climb representation graph on the MoonBoard

test.py - used for temporary tests during dev
